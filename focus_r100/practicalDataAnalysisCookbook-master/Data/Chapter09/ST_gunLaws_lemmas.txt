WASHINGTON
AP
President
Barack
Obama
moved
Monday
to
expand
background
check
to
cover
more
firearm
sold
at
gun
show
online
and
anywhere
else
aiming
to
curb
a
scourge
of
gun
violence
despite
unyielding
opposition
to
new
law
in
Congress
Obama
s
plan
to
broaden
background
check
form
the
centerpiece
of
a
broader
package
of
gun
control
measure
the
president
plan
to
take
on
his
own
in
his
final
year
in
office

Washington
state
voter
last
fall
passed
Initiative
594
that
expanded
background
check
for
gun
buyer
to
include
private
sale
and
transfer
such
a
those
conducted
online
or
at
gun
show
Gun
store
owner
moving
out
of
Seattle
because
of
new
tax
This
is
not
going
to
solve
every
violent
crime
in
this
country
Obama
said
Still
he
added
It
will
potentially
save
life
and
spare
family
the
pain
of
these
extraordinary
loss
Under
current
law
only
federally
licensed
gun
dealer
must
conduct
background
check
on
buyer
but
many
who
sell
gun
at
flea
market
on
website
or
in
other
informal
setting
don
t
register
a
dealer
Gun
control
advocate
say
that
loophole
is
exploited
to
skirt
the
background
check
requirement
Now
the
Justice
Department
s
Bureau
of
Alcohol
Tobacco
Firearms
and
Explosives
will
issue
updated
guidance
that
say
the
government
should
deem
anyone
in
the
business
of
selling
gun
to
be
a
dealer
regardless
of
where
he
or
she
sell
the
gun
To
that
end
the
government
will
consider
other
factor
including
how
many
gun
a
person
sell
and
how
frequently
and
whether
those
gun
are
sold
for
a
profit
The
executive
action
on
gun
control
fall
far
short
of
what
Obama
and
likeminded
lawmaker
attempted
to
accomplish
with
legislation
in
2013
after
a
massacre
at
a
Connecticut
elementary
school
that
shook
the
nation
s
conscience
Even
still
the
more
modest
measure
were
sure
to
spark
legal
challenge
from
those
who
oppose
any
new
impediment
to
buying
gun
We
re
very
comfortable
that
the
president
can
legally
take
these
action
said
Attorney
General
Loretta
Lynch
Obama
s
announcement
wa
hailed
by
Democratic
lawmaker
and
gun
control
group
like
the
Brady
Campaign
to
Prevent
Gun
Violence
which
claimed
Obama
wa
making
history
with
bold
and
meaningful
action
that
would
make
all
Americans
safer
Hillary
Clinton
at
a
rally
in
Iowa
said
she
wa
so
proud
of
Obama
but
warned
that
the
next
president
could
easily
undo
his
change
I
won
t
wipe
it
away
Clinton
said
But
Republicans
were
quick
to
accuse
Obama
of
gross
overreach
Sen
Bob
Corker
R
Tenn
denounced
Obama
s
step
a
divisive
and
detrimental
to
real
solution
I
will
work
with
my
colleague
to
respond
appropriately
to
ensure
the
Constitution
is
respected
Corker
said
Far
from
mandating
background
check
for
all
gun
sale
the
new
guidance
still
exempts
collector
and
gun
hobbyist
and
the
exact
definition
of
who
must
register
a
a
dealer
and
conduct
background
check
remains
exceedingly
vague
The
administration
did
not
issue
a
number
for
how
many
gun
someone
must
sell
to
be
considered
a
dealer
instead
saying
it
planned
to
remind
people
that
court
have
deemed
people
to
be
dealer
in
some
case
even
if
they
only
sell
a
handful
of
gun
And
the
background
check
provision
rest
in
the
murky
realm
of
agency
guideline
which
have
le
force
than
full
fledged
federal
regulation
and
can
easily
be
rescinded
Many
of
the
Republican
presidential
candidate
running
to
succeed
Obama
have
vowed
to
rip
up
his
new
gun
restriction
upon
taking
office
In
an
attempt
to
prevent
gun
purchase
from
falling
through
the
crack
the
FBI
will
hire
230
more
examiner
to
process
background
check
the
White
House
said
an
increase
of
about
50
percent
Many
of
the
roughly
63
000
background
check
request
each
day
are
processed
within
second
But
if
the
system
kick
back
a
request
for
further
review
the
government
only
ha
three
day
before
federal
law
say
the
buyer
can
return
and
buy
the
gun
without
being
cleared
That
weak
spot
in
the
system
came
under
scrutiny
last
summer
when
the
FBI
revealed
that
Dylann
Roof
the
accused
gunman
in
the
Charleston
S
C
church
massacre
wa
improperly
allowed
to
buy
a
gun
because
incomplete
record
keeping
and
miscommunication
among
authority
delayed
processing
of
his
background
check
beyond
the
three
day
limit
The
White
House
also
said
it
planned
to
ask
Congress
for
500
million
to
improve
mental
health
care
and
Obama
issued
a
memorandum
directing
federal
agency
to
conduct
or
sponsor
research
into
smart
gun
technology
that
reduces
the
risk
of
accidental
gun
discharge
The
Obama
administration
also
plan
to
complete
a
rule
already
in
the
work
to
close
another
loophole
that
allows
trust
or
corporation
to
purchase
sawed
off
shotgun
machine
gun
and
similar
weapon
without
background
check
Obama
planned
to
announce
the
new
measure
at
an
event
at
the
White
House
on
Tuesday
a
he
continued
a
weeklong
push
to
promote
the
gun
effort
and
push
back
on
it
critic
He
met
at
the
White
House
on
Monday
with
Democratic
lawmaker
who
have
supported
stricter
gun
control
and
planned
to
take
his
argument
to
prime
time
Thursday
with
a
televised
town
hall
discussion
The
initiative
also
promised
to
be
prominent
in
Obama
s
final
State
of
the
Union
address
next
week
Whether
the
new
step
will
effectively
prevent
future
gun
death
remained
unclear
